      <p>
      My name is Christopher Longsworth, and I’m an aspiring software developer from the Space Coast of Florida. At 20 years old, I’m diving headfirst into the world of coding, currently learning the ins and outs of web development through UCF’s Coding Boot Camp..
      </p>
      <p>While I’m still sharpening my skills and gaining efficiency, I’m passionate about technology and excited to build innovative applications that make life easier and more enjoyable.</p>
      <p>When I’m not coding, you’ll often find me at the beach, taking in the coastal vibes and recharging my creativity. This portfolio is a snapshot of my journey so far thank you for joining me as I work toward becoming a professional developer!</p>
